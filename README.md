# MESC-Net_Sep_Dict

This is a python demo for the paper:<br />
**Chuyang Ye et al., "An Improved Deep Network for Tissue Microstructure
Estimation with Uncertainty Quantification", MedIA 2020.** 

The demo includes both the training and test phase for the deterministic and probabilistic tissue microstructure estimation. Therefore, to run it, both the training and test data (which are images in the NIfTI format) should be prepared. The input diffusion signals should be normalized by the b0 signals.

There are a few dependencies that need to be installed:<br />
**numpy <br />
nibabel <br />
keras <br />
theano <br />
tqdm <br />**

TO DO:
Here is how to run the scripts <br />
